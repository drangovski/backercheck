# Backerlist - Kickstarter Backers Analytic Tool

This is small Django app that is using Kickstarter's campaign backers informaton file in order to organize, analyze and visualize various statistics for
a Kickstarter's campaign backers, such as returning vs new backers, total pledged amount per backer, number of games pledged per backer and etc. Additionally, it tracks which users are new / returning to a campaign from a mailing list.

It was intentended to use as an internal tool in my company and it's not polished 100%.
